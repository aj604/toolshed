# Decisions

## 2026-06-09 — Documentation skills suite design
- Decided: Activity-centered suite — one skill per documentation activity, doc-type knowledge
  in per-artifact reference files — designing four skills (bootstrapping-docs, writing-docs,
  detecting-doc-drift, doc-sync-automation; its 2026-06-20 updates add `fixing-doc-drift` and
  merge writing-for-llms into `writing-docs`, dispatching `llm-doc-writer`) on a verifiability
  spine with two claim classes (verifiable / marked+anchored rationale), rather than a single
  monolithic doc-writing skill or a Diátaxis-page-per-type split; ADRs explicitly out of scope
  (YAGNI). The suite has since grown to 8 skills and two agents on the same contract (the
  2026-07-02/03 entries below).
- Still binds: every doc-lifecycle skill's job maps to exactly one documentation activity; the
  verifiability contract (verifiable claim or marked+anchored rationale claim) is shared
  across the suite, not owned by any single skill.

## 2026-07-03 — Doc bloat and distillation plan
- Decided: Built `detecting-doc-bloat`/`fixing-doc-bloat` as a matched RED→GREEN pair per the
  writing-skills methodology, mirroring `detecting-doc-drift`/`fixing-doc-drift`'s build process.
- Still binds: RED/GREEN baselines are retained under `tests/baselines/` rather than discarded
  once the skill goes green.
- Code: `tests/baselines/bloat-red/`, `tests/baselines/bloat-fixing-red/`

## 2026-07-03 — Doc bloat and distillation design
- Decided: Added `detecting-doc-bloat`/`fixing-doc-bloat` as a second skill pair mirroring
  `detecting-doc-drift`/`fixing-doc-drift`'s shape (contract-emitting detector + human-gated
  applier), covering the value axis (drift covers accuracy). `DISTILL` retires a landed
  planning artifact by extracting its durable decisions into living docs plus one
  decision-log entry, then deleting it — chosen over keeping design docs verbatim forever or
  per-line-cutting them.
- Still binds: the apply-only discipline for fix skills has one owner
  (`plugins/doc-lifecycle/references/apply-discipline.md`); `DISTILL`'s two-status model
  (`pending-implementation` forbids payload, `ready` requires verified claims + one
  decision-log entry) is closed.

## 2026-07-02 — Doc-sync automation plan
- Decided: Doc-sync automation was built test-first, with RED/GREEN/E2E records under
  `tests/baselines/doc-sync-setup-red/`.
- Still binds: mechanical gate failures (a malformed `drift-report.json`) fail the sync-gate job
  red rather than degrading silently — `validate-drift-output.py` exits nonzero on shape errors
  and the workflow's validate step carries no `continue-on-error`. The shipped `doc-sync.yml` has
  since moved past this plan's literal task steps (e.g. onto `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`,
  per `docs/plans/HANDOFF.md`'s Row 5 note) — the plan's own code blocks are retired as stale
  procedure, not current truth.

## 2026-07-02 — Doc-sync automation design
- Decided: Chose a GitHub Action runner over a Claude scheduled task (ties to one user's
  account) or local git/session hooks (fire only while someone works), with marker-based
  idempotency and a blast-radius cap that escalates to an issue rather than one giant PR;
  posture is fail loud, never half-apply.
- Still binds: nightly sync runs as a GitHub Action (`schedule` + `workflow_dispatch`);
  `.github/doc-sync-marker` advances only on a clean-run direct commit or a merged sync PR;
  a blast-radius cap escalates to a labeled issue instead of one giant PR.

## 2026-07-03/04 — Doc bloat nightly plan
- Decided: `doc-bloat.yml` built test-first (`sync-gate_test.py`, `render-report_test.py`
  extended with bloat-* cases) as a sibling to `doc-sync.yml`, sharing `sync-gate.py`/
  `render-report.py` rather than forking new scripts; already exercised for real (PR #23,
  merged 2026-07-04).
- Still binds: the weekly bloat sweep splits findings into two lanes by verdict — `prune`
  (`CUT`/`CONDENSE`/`EXTRACT-AND-MOVE`, passage-level) and `distill` (`MERGE-DOC`/`RETIRE-DOC`, or
  `DISTILL` with `status: ready`, doc-level); a `DISTILL` `pending-implementation` record belongs
  to neither lane and is never opened as a PR.

## 2026-07-03 — Doc bloat nightly design
- Decided: Bloat sweep output is a proposal (draft PR), never an auto-fix, because a bloat
  verdict is a judgment call, not a mechanically-checkable correction; the merge itself is the
  human approval gate — chosen over drift's detect→fix pipeline shape.
- Still binds: `doc-bloat.yml` stays a separate sibling workflow from `doc-sync.yml`, each with
  its own concurrency group, because drift's marker-based detect-fix model and bloat's
  marker-less detect-propose model would tangle if combined; bloat output is always a draft PR,
  never auto-merged or direct-committed, and a lane is skipped if its own draft PR is already
  open.

## 2026-07-03 — doc-sync PR body tightening plan
- Decided: PR-body/title rendering moved from inline YAML `jq` (as originally planned) into
  tested Python (`render-report.py`), the same pattern later reused for the bloat lanes.
- Still binds: any future PR-body/title change belongs in `render-report.py`, with a
  `render-report_test.py` case, never inline YAML.
- Code: `.github/doc-sync/render-report.py`, `tests/scripts/render-report_test.py`

## 2026-07-03 — doc-sync PR body tightening design
- Decided: Tightened doc-sync PR bodies to two compact tables (Fixed/Flagged) with a
  singular/plural, flagged-count-bearing title, and tightened drift evidence to a one-line
  pointer+fact bar — both changes reduce PR review noise without changing what's checked.
- Still binds: drift evidence stays a one-line pointer+fact bar (no history, no restated
  command output, no reasoning narrative — the verdict carries the conclusion, evidence
  carries only what proves it); sync PR bodies render as two tables (Fixed/Flagged) with a
  counts-bearing singular/plural title, no raw-report `<details>` block.

## 2026-07-03 — Doc bloat inventory tool design
- Decided: Replaced ad-hoc find/ls doc enumeration with a tested `list-docs.py` helper
  (git-ls-files-based, config-driven via `audit-scope.json`), keeping the CI allowlist thin and
  inventory logic unit-tested (`tests/scripts/list-docs_test.py`) rather than improvised per
  invocation.
- Still binds: doc enumeration for the bloat audit goes through `list-docs.py` and
  `audit-scope.json`'s include/exclude globs, never a hand-rolled `find`/`ls` in CI YAML.
- Code: `plugins/doc-lifecycle/skills/detecting-doc-bloat/scripts/list-docs.py`,
  `.github/doc-sync/audit-scope.json`

## 2026-06-20 — Reference-doc containment design
- Decided: `bootstrapping-docs`' `docs/reference/` containment convention marked "implemented"
  after all five concrete edits landed in `repo-shape.md`/`SKILL.md`, including demoting the
  standing "Not yet documented" section to a one-time bootstrap-exit record (`docs/doc-scope.md`,
  owned by `growing-docs`).
- Still binds: the convention (for repos that opt in) contains the whole agent doc set in one
  subtree, never scattered at `docs/` root; `architecture.md` is the sole cross-unit doc and must
  not re-describe any single unit. This repo itself opts out (see CLAUDE.md).

## 2026-07-04 — Durable narrative docs + DISTILL insight extraction
- Decided: Added a third doc kind — the durable narrative doc, marked by growing-docs' first-line
  `> As of <date> (<anchors>)` anchor (the marker classifies, not the directory) and homed in
  `docs/reference/` (plain `docs/` until that tree exists, never `docs/plans/`); grew the
  `DISTILL ready` payload an optional anchored `insights` channel with a mandatory per-section
  insight walk; made the always-loaded file a router, not a repository (single owner:
  `writing-docs/agent-context.md`), with unprompted-critical as a scope test.
- Still binds: an anchored doc is never a planning artifact to distill, wherever it sits; every
  `ready` record's evidence states its insight-walk outcome (`insight sweep: none — …` when dry);
  a `ready` payload must carry at least one claim or one insight; anything landing content in
  CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md — extraction, claim, or merge — must clear the router rule.

## 2026-07-02 — Growing docs (demand-driven expansion) design
- Decided: Added `growing-docs` as a distinct sibling skill rather than extending
  `bootstrapping-docs` (the two trigger contexts — 'repo has no docs' vs 'docs exist but a demand
  signal fired' — would fire for neither in one description); growth is demand-triggered via the
  second-rediscovery rule, one signal → one smallest artifact; `bootstrapping-docs` now exits by
  writing `docs/doc-scope.md`, whose format `growing-docs` single-owns.
- Still binds: growth requires a nameable demand signal (never milestones or scheduled review);
  narrative docs (walkthrough/tutorial/ADR) carry the required `> As of` first-line anchor and
  stay outside writing-docs' claim bar; bootstrapping-docs' STOP list binds growth too;
  `docs/doc-scope.md` is read on demand, never a standing section in an always-loaded file.
