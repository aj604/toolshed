# doc-lifecycle engine

Stdlib-only Python package (`doclifecycle`) behind the plugin's skills and workflows. No
third-party dependencies. Library functions are the implementation; the commands wrap them and
add nothing, so an import and a command cannot disagree.

Current surface: the registry parser, the document inventory, and path authorization. Report
contract, segmenter, cache, approval sets, and the applier land in later slices of the
re-architecture (issue #57).

## Modules

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `doclifecycle/registry.py` | registry parsing, validation, classification, glob matching, registry digest |
| `doclifecycle/inventory.py` | `build_inventory()`, the closed-world walk, document/inventory digests |
| `doclifecycle/paths.py` | `authorize_path()`, `classify_target()`, the canonical path form and target classes |
| `doclifecycle/results.py` | `Problem`, `Invalid`, the `ok`/`invalid` status strings |
| `doclifecycle/digest.py` | `sha256_file`, `sha256_canonical`, the canonical JSON form digests are taken over |
| `doclifecycle/cli.py`, `__main__.py`, `doc-lifecycle.py` | argv parsing and exit codes only |

## The registry

`.doc-lifecycle/registry.json` (override with `--registry`). It owns classification;
content-coupled facts (as-of, anchors, lifecycle state) stay in the documents.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "roots": ["docs", "CLAUDE.md"],
  "exclude": ["docs/vendor"],
  "sets": ["adr"],
  "extensions": [".md"],
  "rules": [
    {"glob": "docs/**/*.md", "kind": "living"},
    {"glob": "docs/adr/*.md", "kind": "narrative", "set": "adr"}
  ]
}
```

- `roots` (required, non-empty) — declared documentation roots. A root is a subtree or a
  single file. Roots may not overlap or repeat (`registry-overlapping-root`), so a document
  belongs to exactly one root. Classification is closed-world *within* the roots: a document
  under a root that no rule claims is an `unregistered-document` finding; a file outside every
  root is not documentation and is not reported.
- `rules` (required) — evaluated in order, **last match wins**, so broad defaults go first
  and narrower overrides after. `kind` is `living`, `narrative`, or `planning`. `set` is
  optional and must be declared in `sets`.
- `exclude` (optional) — paths skipped entirely, neither inventoried nor reported. Naming a
  directory excludes everything beneath it, and the subtree is pruned rather than walked.
- `extensions` (optional, default `[".md"]`) — which files under a root are documents, and so
  what the closed-world rule covers. Files with other suffixes are not documentation and are
  not reported; widen this list rather than leaving formats silently outside coverage.
- Globs: `*` and `?` stop at `/`; `**/` spans zero or more directories, so
  `docs/**/*.md` matches both `docs/a.md` and `docs/deep/a.md`.

Validation fails closed and reports every problem it finds in one pass. An unparseable,
unreadable, or invalid registry — including a declared root that does not exist — yields
`status: "invalid"` with typed problems and **no** documents: never a partial inventory.
Symlinks under a root are reported as `symlinked-path` and never followed. The inventory walk
enumerates; `paths.authorize_path()` below decides what may be read or written, and the applier
slice (issue #69) is what routes through it.

## Inventory command

From a plugin checkout, with nothing to set up:

```bash
python3 <plugin>/engine/doc-lifecycle.py inventory --repo . --registry .doc-lifecycle/registry.json
```

Equivalently, with the engine directory on `PYTHONPATH`:

```bash
python3 -m doclifecycle inventory --repo .
```

Both flags are optional (`--repo` defaults to the current directory). Exit codes: `0` the
run completed — findings are data, not a gate; `1` the run is invalid; `2` usage error.

Real output for a repository containing exactly `.doc-lifecycle/registry.json` (root `docs`,
one rule `docs/adr/*.md → narrative, set adr`), `docs/adr/0001-use-json.md` holding
`# 1. Use JSON`, and an unregistered `docs/notes.md` holding `# Notes`:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "schema_version": 1,
  "registry": {
    "path": ".doc-lifecycle/registry.json",
    "digest": "f3188f08325acfcd2522439e2678df48cedc211739046661349e49c96ee3ddb1"
  },
  "digest": "6e2d949654d63ba6792a84438718e2d91b21139a90ed00dab5f7c93cb6759b05",
  "documents": [
    {
      "path": "docs/adr/0001-use-json.md",
      "kind": "narrative",
      "set": "adr",
      "rule": "docs/adr/*.md",
      "digest": "3066549a907fd6462e87041895ef45d9e22380d7345df1e9b307c4fcc102b05d"
    }
  ],
  "findings": [
    {
      "code": "unregistered-document",
      "path": "docs/notes.md",
      "message": "docs/notes.md is under declared root 'docs' but matches no registry rule — classify it or exclude it"
    }
  ]
}
```

The registry and inventory digests above hold only for that exact registry text's *meaning*
and those file bytes; reformatting the registry leaves them unchanged.

An invalid run prints the same payload shape with `"status": "invalid"` and a `problems`
array, repeats each problem on stderr, and exits 1.

The library call behind it:

```python
from doclifecycle.inventory import build_inventory

result = build_inventory(".")          # → Inventory (status "ok") or Invalid
result.to_dict()                       # → the payload above, as a dict
```

## Path authorization

`doclifecycle/paths.py` decides what may be read or written on behalf of a record. It is the
engine's one place for that decision by design; the applier slice (issue #69) is the caller that
routes through it, and until then nothing in the engine calls it.

For a repository where `docs/architecture.md` exists as a regular non-symlinked file:

```python
from doclifecycle.paths import authorize_path

decision = authorize_path("docs/architecture.md", repo_root=".", roots=("docs",))
decision.authorized      # True
decision.path            # "docs/architecture.md" — the canonical form, or None when refused
decision.root            # "docs" — the declared root containing it, or None
decision.target_class    # "documentation"; on a class refusal, the class detected instead
decision.problem         # None, or a results.Problem with a typed code
```

`roots` are repository-relative, each a subtree or a single file. `target_class` defaults to
`"documentation"` and is the only value `DECLARABLE_TARGET_CLASSES` accepts — the dangerous
classes are not a default a record, a plan, or a consumer config can switch off.

A verdict is a function of the path, the roots, the target class, and the state of `repo_root` on
disk: the same inputs always give the same `Authorization`, and nothing else is consulted. The
disk is part of the question because an alias is only visible there — `classify_target()` below is
the half that is pure, and the rest of the checks resolve what the path actually points at.

Refusal, not repair: `docs//a.md` is refused rather than rewritten to `docs/a.md`, so one file
never has two authorizable spellings. There is no partial verdict — a refusal carries no path.

Checks run in the order below, and the first one that fires is the verdict.

| Code | Refused because |
|---|---|
| `path-empty` | empty or blank |
| `path-control-character` | a Unicode `Cc`/`Cf`/`Cs`/`Co`/`Cn` character, including invisible reordering ones |
| `path-absolute` | leading `/` or `~`, or a drive letter |
| `path-separator` | `\` used as a separator |
| `path-whitespace` | any whitespace, leading, trailing, or interior |
| `path-unicode-non-canonical` | not in Unicode NFC form |
| `path-traversal` | a `..` component |
| `path-non-canonical` | a `.` or empty component — `./`, `//`, or a trailing `/` |
| `path-leading-dash` | a component starting with `-`, which reads as an option |
| `roots-undeclared` | no roots were declared, so nothing is eligible |
| `roots-invalid` | a declared root is not itself canonically spelled |
| `target-class-undeclarable` | the caller named a class the engine never writes |
| `repo-root-missing` | `repo_root` is not a directory |
| `path-outside-root` | canonical, but under none of the declared roots |
| `root-missing` | the containing root is not in the repository |
| `path-case-mismatch` | an existing entry differs only by case |
| `path-unicode-collision` | an existing entry differs only by Unicode normalization |
| `path-unreadable` | a directory on the way cannot be listed, so collisions are unknown |
| `symlinked-path` | the path or one of its ancestors is a symlink |
| `path-not-a-file` | not a regular file — a directory, a fifo, or an ancestor that is a file |
| `path-hardlinked` | more than one name points at the file |
| `path-executable-mode` | the file is marked executable |
| `path-forbidden-class` | its class is not the declared target class |

`classify_target(path)` is the pure classifier behind `path-forbidden-class`, returning
`documentation`, `workflow`, `source`, `configuration`, `credential`, `hook`, `executable`, or
`other`. It is ordered most-dangerous-first, matches case-folded (the filesystems this runs on
fold case, so `.GIT/hooks/` is the hooks directory), and matches directory prefixes at a
component boundary anywhere in the path — so `docs/.github/workflows/ci.yml` is `workflow`, not
documentation, and living under a documentation root launders nothing. `other` is the fallback
rather than `documentation`: eligibility is a positive list, so an unrecognized shape is refused
too.

A path that does not exist yet is authorizable — `create-document` must be able to name its
target before anything is written there. Ancestors that do exist are still checked, so a new
file cannot be created behind an alias or under a case-folded twin of an existing directory.

## Digests

`digest.sha256_canonical` hashes the canonical JSON form (sorted keys, compact separators),
so reformatting a registry is not a new registry while changing a rule is. Rule order is part
of the registry digest because it decides precedence; root, exclude, set, and extension order
is normalized away. A document's digest is the sha256 of its bytes. The inventory digest covers
the registry digest, every document entry, and each finding's code and path — not finding
messages, which are prose.

## Tests

`tests/engine/*_test.py` (stdlib `unittest`), run by ordinary discovery, which is also how
CI runs them (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, "Engine tests"):

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/engine -p '*_test.py'
```

Seams under test: `build_inventory()` and `authorize_path()` as library calls, and the commands
as subprocesses whose payload must equal `build_inventory(...).to_dict()`. Path authorization has
no command of its own — it is substrate the other components call. Shared fixtures live in
`tests/engine/support.py`.
